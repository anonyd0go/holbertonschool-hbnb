## High Level Package Diagram
1. Presentation Layer

    * Responsibilities:
        * Exposes the API endpoints that the client applications interact with.
        * Handles HTTP requests, input validation, and response formatting.
        * Manages services like user registration, place creation, review submission, and retrieving places.
    * Key Components:
        * **API Endpoints & Services**: These provide the interface for client interactions (e.g., `register_user()`, `create_place()`).

2. **Facade Component**
    * **Role**:
        * Acts as an intermediary between the Presentation and Business Logic layers.
        * Simplifies the interface exposed to the Presentation layer.
        * Encapsulates the complexity of the underlying business logic by providing a unified method (e.g., `handleRequest()`).
    * **Benefits**:
        * Encapsulation: Hides internal implementation details.
        * Loose Coupling: Allows changes in business logic without impacting the presentation layer.
        * Simplified Communication: Provides a consistent entry point for all business operations.

3. **Business Logic Layer**
    * Responsibilities:
        * Implements the core business rules and processes.
        * Manages entities such as User, Place, Review, and Amenity.
        * Performs operations like data validation and processing of requests.
    * Key Operations:
        * `validate_data()` & `process_request()`: Ensures that business rules are correctly applied before interacting with the persistence layer.

4. **Persistence Layer**
    * Responsibilities:
        * Manages all interactions with the database.
        * Provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for all entities.
        * Abstracts the complexity of data storage from the business logic.
    * Key Operations:
        * `save()`, `update()`, `delete()`, `query()`: Handle the underlying database operations.
## How the Facade Pattern Facilitates Communication
* Simplified Interface:
    The **Facade** component serves as a single point of contact for the Presentation Layer. It accepts requests (e.g., user registration, place creation) and delegates them to the appropriate business logic methods.

* Encapsulation of Complexity:
    The internal operations of the Business Logic Layer (such as data validation and entity management) remain hidden behind the Facade. This means that any changes or enhancements in the business logic can be made without affecting the Presentation Layer.

* Loose Coupling:
    By decoupling the Presentation Layer from the Business Logic and Persistence Layers, the facade pattern ensures that each layer can evolve independently. This improves the maintainability and scalability of the overall system.

* Clear Communication Pathway:
The diagram shows a clear pathway:
    * **PresentationLayer** → **Facade**: API calls are funneled through the Facade.
    * **Facade** → **BusinessLogicLayer**: The Facade delegates business-specific requests.
    * **BusinessLogicLayer** → **PersistenceLayer**: Finally, the Business Logic Layer interacts with the database.
