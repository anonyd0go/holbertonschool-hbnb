## Part 2: Implementation of Business Logic and API Endpoints
In this part of the HBnB Project, will consist of the implementation phase of the application based on the design developed in the previous part. The focus of this phase is to build the Presentation and Business Logic layers of the application using Python and Flask. I will implement the core functionality by defining the necessary classes, methods, and endpoints that will serve as the foundation for the application’s operation.

In this part, I will create the structure of the project, develop the classes that define the business logic, and implement the API endpoints. The goal is to bring the documented architecture to life by setting up the key functionalities, such as creating and managing users, places, reviews, and amenities, while adhering to best practices in API design.

The services layer will be built using Flask and the `flask-restx` extension to create RESTful APIs.

## Objectives:
1. Set Up the Project Structure:
    * Organize the project into a modular architecture, following best practices for Python and Flask applications.
    * Create the necessary packages for the Presentation and Business Logic layers.

2. Implement the Business Logic Layer:
    * Develop the core classes for the business logic, including User, Place, Review, and Amenity entities.
    * Implement relationships between entities and define how they interact within the application.
    * Implement the facade pattern to simplify communication between the Presentation and Business Logic layers.

3. Build RESTful API Endpoints:
    * Implement the necessary API endpoints to handle CRUD operations for Users, Places, Reviews, and Amenities.
    * Use flask-restx to define and document the API, ensuring a clear and consistent structure.
    * Implement data serialization to return extended attributes for related objects. For example, when retrieving a Place, the API should include details such as the owner’s first_name, last_name, and relevant amenities.

4. Test and Validate the API:
    * Ensure that each endpoint works correctly and handles edge cases appropriately.
    * Use tools like Postman or cURL to test your API endpoints.
